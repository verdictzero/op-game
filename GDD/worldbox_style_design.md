# Cosmic WorldBox - Sandbox God Game Design
*A hands-off cosmic civilization sandbox where worlds evolve on their own*

## Core Design Philosophy

**Primary Principle**: The world lives and breathes without player input. Civilizations rise and fall, evolve and transcend, fight and cooperate - all autonomously. The player is an observer-god who can intervene but doesn't need to.

## Visual & Feel

### Art Style
- **Pixel Art**: Clean, readable pixel art similar to WorldBox
- **Top-Down View**: Bird's eye perspective of the world
- **Living World**: Constant motion - units moving, buildings being constructed, battles, etc.
- **Scale Transitions**: Smooth zoom from individual creatures to galactic view
- **Visual Feedback**: Everything has immediate visual representation

### Visual Scales
```
PLANETARY VIEW (Default)
- See individual creatures as pixels
- Buildings and structures visible
- Terrain features, biomes, resources
- Weather effects, disasters

SYSTEM VIEW (Zoomed out)
- Planets as spheres with visible activity
- Space ships as moving dots
- Megastructures under construction
- Stellar phenomena

GALACTIC VIEW (Maximum zoom)
- Star systems as glowing points
- Civilization territories as colored regions
- Galactic phenomena and cosmic events
```

## Autonomous World Systems

### Civilization AI Behaviors

#### Primitive Era (Type 0.0-0.5)
**Autonomous Actions**:
- Units explore and settle new lands
- Build villages near resources
- Develop agriculture when population density increases
- Form tribes and early kingdoms
- Fight over territory and resources
- Discover fire, tools, writing on their own

**Visual Indicators**:
- Smoke from fires
- Paths forming between settlements
- Fields appearing around villages
- Battle animations with primitive weapons

#### Advanced Era (Type 0.5-1.0)
**Autonomous Actions**:
- Cities expand and build walls
- Trade routes form between cities
- Technologies spread between civilizations
- Wars become organized with armies
- Industrial revolution emerges naturally
- Space programs begin

**Visual Indicators**:
- Factories with smoke
- Roads and railways connecting cities
- Satellites launching
- Nuclear explosions (when wars escalate)

#### Space Era (Type 1.0-2.0)
**Autonomous Actions**:
- Colonies established on other planets
- Dyson sphere construction begins
- Interstellar wars and alliances
- Civilizations may achieve AI singularity
- Some transcend to energy beings

**Visual Indicators**:
- Ships traveling between planets
- Megastructures being built
- Planets being terraformed
- Energy beings as glowing entities

### Emergent Behaviors

#### Natural Evolution
- Species evolve based on environment
- Civilizations develop unique cultures
- Technologies discovered in different orders
- Religions and philosophies emerge
- Art and monuments created autonomously

#### Conflict & Cooperation
- Wars start over resources, territory, ideology
- Alliances form against common threats
- Trade networks establish naturally
- Civilizations may merge peacefully
- Galactic federations emerge

#### Crisis Response
- Civilizations adapt to disasters
- Mass migrations during climate change
- Technology races during existential threats
- Heroes emerge during dark times
- Civilizations can rebuild from near-extinction

## God Powers (Player Interactions)

### Creation Powers
- **Life Seed**: Drop to start evolution on a planet
- **Resource Blessing**: Create resource deposits
- **Terrain Sculpting**: Raise/lower land, create oceans
- **Cosmic Objects**: Place stars, planets, asteroids

### Intervention Powers
- **Inspire**: Accelerate technological development
- **Divine Wrath**: Natural disasters, meteor strikes
- **Blessing/Curse**: Boost or hinder civilizations
- **Time Control**: Speed up, slow down, pause
- **Direct Control**: Temporarily control a civilization

### Cosmic Powers (Late Game)
- **Create Wormholes**: Connect distant regions
- **Stellar Engineering**: Move/create stars
- **Reality Manipulation**: Change physical laws
- **Dimensional Rifts**: Open portals to other universes

### Observation Tools
- **Time Lapse**: Watch recorded history
- **Statistics**: Track civilization progress
- **Family Trees**: Follow bloodlines and dynasties
- **Tech Trees**: See discovered technologies
- **Event Log**: Major events in text form

## World Generation

### Planet Generation
- Procedural continents and oceans
- Biome distribution based on climate
- Resource placement affects civilization development
- Hidden anomalies and mysteries
- Multiple planet types (earth-like, desert, ocean, etc.)

### Life Seeding
- Different starter species available
- Each species has tendencies (aggressive, peaceful, scientific)
- Environmental factors affect evolution
- Multiple species can exist on one planet
- Alien species have unique development paths

## Progression Without Management

### Automatic Development
**Population Growth**
- Based on food, space, and happiness
- Diseases and disasters provide natural limits
- Civilizations manage their own expansion

**Technology Progress**
- Based on population, resources, and culture
- Knowledge spreads through contact
- Some civs stagnate, others advance rapidly
- Breakthrough moments happen randomly

**Resource Management**
- Civilizations automatically exploit resources
- Trade networks form based on needs
- Resource depletion forces adaptation
- Advanced civs create artificial resources

### Natural Story Generation
- First contact between civilizations
- Rise and fall of empires
- Legendary heroes and villains
- Great discoveries and inventions
- Cosmic mysteries uncovered
- Transcendence attempts (success or failure)

## Technical Design

### Simulation Engine
- **Real-time**: Constant simulation with pause/speed options
- **Multi-threaded**: Different systems run in parallel
- **LOD System**: Detailed simulation near camera, simplified far away
- **Event System**: Major events trigger visual effects and notifications

### Performance Optimization
- Sprite batching for thousands of units
- Simplified physics for distant objects
- AI decision-making on separate threads
- Procedural generation for infinite universes

### Save System
- Auto-save the entire universe state
- Time-lapse recording of major events
- Share worlds with other players
- Mod support for custom content

## Unique Features vs Standard WorldBox

### Cosmic Scale
- Multiple planets and star systems
- Galactic civilization development
- Universal phenomena and threats
- Transcendence and ascension

### Deep Simulation
- Realistic technology progression
- Complex diplomatic relationships
- Cultural evolution and philosophy
- Multiple victory/transcendence paths

### Intervention Depth

## Minimum Viable Product

### Core Features (3-4 months)
1. Basic world generation with biomes
2. Primitive civilization AI (settling, building, fighting)
3. Simple god powers (life seed, disasters, blessings)
4. Real-time simulation with speed control
5. Basic pixel art assets

### Early Access (6-8 months)

## Design Principles

1. **Hands-Off Entertainment**: Fun to watch without interaction
2. **Meaningful Intervention**: When you act, it matters
3. **Emergent Storytelling**: Every world tells unique stories
4. **Visual Clarity**: Everything important is visible
5. **Accessible Depth**: Easy to start, deep to master
6. **Performance First**: Smooth even with massive simulations
7. **Moddable**: Community can add content easily

This design maintains the addictive "just watching" quality of WorldBox while adding the epic scope of cosmic civilization development. Players can spend hours just observing their universes evolve, occasionally nudging things with god powers when they want to see what happens.
