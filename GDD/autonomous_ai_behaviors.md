# Autonomous AI Behavior System
*Making civilizations live without player input*

## Core AI Philosophy

**Principle**: Every entity acts based on needs, environment, and personality. No scripted events - everything emerges from individual and collective behaviors interacting.

## Individual Unit AI

### Basic Needs Hierarchy
```
SURVIVAL NEEDS (Highest Priority)
├── Food: Seek when hungry
├── Safety: Flee from threats
├── Shelter: Find/build during harsh weather
└── Health: Rest when injured, seek healing

SOCIAL NEEDS (Medium Priority)
├── Companionship: Stay near same species
├── Reproduction: Seek mates when mature
├── Community: Join/form groups
└── Purpose: Take on roles in society

GROWTH NEEDS (Lower Priority)
├── Exploration: Discover new areas
├── Creation: Build, craft, improve
├── Knowledge: Learn from experiences
└── Transcendence: Seek higher meaning
```

### Personality Traits
Each unit has randomized traits affecting behavior:

```
TRAIT SPECTRUMS (0-100 scale)
- Aggressive ←→ Peaceful
- Explorer ←→ Settler  
- Social ←→ Solitary
- Innovative ←→ Traditional
- Greedy ←→ Generous
- Brave ←→ Cautious
- Leader ←→ Follower
- Spiritual ←→ Material
```

### Decision Making
```python
# Pseudo-code for individual decisions
def make_decision(unit):
    needs = calculate_needs(unit)
    opportunities = scan_environment(unit)
    
    for need in needs.sorted_by_priority():
        actions = get_actions_for_need(need, opportunities)
        for action in actions:
            if personality_allows(unit, action):
                return execute_action(action)
```

## Collective Civilization AI

### Settlement Behaviors

#### Village Formation
**Triggers**:
- Population density reaches threshold
- Resources abundant in area
- Natural defensive position

**Autonomous Actions**:
- Units build huts near each other
- Paths form between buildings
- Communal areas develop (wells, squares)
- Division of labor emerges

#### City Growth
**Triggers**:
- Village population > 100
- Food surplus exists
- Trade routes established

**Autonomous Actions**:
- Specialized districts form
- Walls built if threats detected
- Markets appear at crossroads
- Monuments built by prosperous civs

### Technology Discovery

#### Innovation System
Technologies discovered through:
1. **Need Pressure**: "We need to cross this river" → Discovers boats
2. **Resource Availability**: "We have copper and tin" → Discovers bronze
3. **Population Density**: "Too many people" → Discovers agriculture
4. **Observation**: "Lightning struck tree" → Discovers fire
5. **Communication**: "Met advanced civ" → Learns from them

#### Tech Spread Mechanics
```
KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER
- Direct Teaching: 5% chance per interaction
- Trade: 2% chance per trade route
- Conquest: 50% chance to capture knowledge
- Independent Discovery: Based on civ traits
- Written Records: Permanent knowledge storage
```

### Cultural Development

#### Belief Systems
Emerge based on experiences:
- Survived disaster → Develops disaster god
- Abundant harvests → Nature worship
- Warrior culture → God of war
- Peaceful society → Philosophy focus

#### Art and Culture
- Successful civs build monuments
- Unique architectural styles develop
- Music and art during prosperity
- Stories preserve historical events

## Era-Specific Behaviors

### Primitive Era (Type 0.0-0.5)

#### Tribal Behaviors
```
DAILY ROUTINES
Morning: Wake, eat, assign tasks
Day: Hunt, gather, build, craft
Evening: Return home, socialize
Night: Sleep, guard rotation

SEASONAL PATTERNS
Spring: Plant crops, expand territory
Summer: Build, trade, explore
Autumn: Harvest, prepare stores
Winter: Craft, tell stories, survive
```

#### Conflict Patterns
- Resource competition triggers raids
- Territory disputes lead to battles
- Strong tribes absorb weak ones
- Alliances form against threats

### Advanced Era (Type 0.5-1.0)

#### Nation Behaviors
```
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS
- Tax collection from cities
- Army recruitment and deployment
- Infrastructure projects
- Diplomatic missions
- Scientific research funding
```

#### Economic Systems
- Trade routes auto-form between cities
- Merchants follow profit opportunities
- Industries develop near resources
- Economic crashes from overextension

### Space Era (Type 1.0+)

#### Expansion Logic
```
COLONIZATION PRIORITIES
1. Moon (closest, practice)
2. Mars (most Earth-like)
3. Asteroids (resources)
4. Outer planets (science)
5. Other systems (prestige)
```

#### Interstellar Behaviors
- Generation ships for distant stars
- Megastructure construction phases
- Resource streams between colonies
- Cultural drift in isolated colonies

## Interaction Dynamics

### Diplomacy AI

#### Relationship Factors
```
POSITIVE INFLUENCES
+ Trade profit
+ Cultural similarity  
+ Common enemies
+ Gifts and aid
+ Shared borders peaceful

NEGATIVE INFLUENCES
- Resource competition
- Cultural differences
- Border disputes
- Past conflicts
- Power imbalance
```

### War Behaviors

#### War Triggers
- Resource scarcity
- Territory pressure
- Ideological differences
- Preventive strikes
- Alliance obligations

#### Military AI
```
TACTICAL BEHAVIORS
- Scout before attacking
- Concentrate forces
- Target weak points
- Retreat when outnumbered
- Siege vs assault decisions
```

## Adaptation and Learning

### Civilization Memory
Each civ remembers:
- Past disasters and solutions
- Successful strategies
- Failed approaches
- Other civs' behaviors
- Historical grudges/friendships

### Behavioral Evolution
```
ADAPTATION EXAMPLES
- Volcanic eruption → Build further from volcanoes
- Plague outbreak → Develop medicine priority
- Invasion → Build better defenses
- Trade success → Expand trade networks
- Tech breakthrough → Focus research
```

## Crisis Response Patterns

### Natural Disasters
```
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
1. Units flee danger zone
2. Leaders organize evacuation
3. Resources redirected to relief
4. Rebuilding begins after

LONG-TERM ADAPTATION
- Building codes change
- Disaster preparations
- Warning systems
- Cultural trauma
```

### Existential Threats
- Meteor approaching → Unite all civs
- Climate collapse → Tech research surge
- Alien invasion → Rapid militarization
- Resource depletion → Efficiency focus

## Emergent Storytelling

### Character Emergence
Special individuals appear randomly:
- Great leaders (unite tribes)
- Inventors (breakthrough tech)
- Prophets (start religions)
- Conquerors (expand empires)
- Explorers (discover new lands)

### Dynasty Systems
- Bloodlines tracked
- Leadership inheritance
- Family feuds and alliances
- Legendary ancestors remembered

### Epic Events
Emerge from AI interactions:
- First contact between civs
- Great wars spanning centuries
- Golden ages of prosperity
- Dark ages of decline
- Miraculous comebacks
