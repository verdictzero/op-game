# Development Notes

## Recent Changes (Session)

### Fixed UI scaling and world generation issues

#### World Generation Stalling Fix:
- **Issue**: Generation was stalling at 126/128 (89%) because WorldGenUI defaulted to 128x128 but WorldGenerator was set to 64x64
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated WorldGenUI default world size from 128 to 64 to match WorldGenerator
  - Increased yielding frequency from every 5 rows to every 2 rows in vegetation and tile creation
  - This prevents frame blocking and ensures smooth progress

#### World Generation UI Layout Fix:
- **Issue**: WorldGenUI was too tall (700px) and got cut off on 16:9 screens
- **Fix**:
  - Completely redesigned WorldGenUI with two-column layout
  - Added ScrollContainer wrapper for better viewport compatibility
  - Reduced height from 700px to 640px and increased width to 900px
  - Left column: World size, seed, presets, climate settings
  - Right column: Resources, progress bar, world statistics
  - Now fits properly in 1280x720 and higher resolutions

#### Other Improvements:
- Added debug output to GameManager and MainMenu for better troubleshooting
- Fixed menu navigation flow - game now starts with proper main menu
- Updated all @onready node paths in WorldGenUI.gd to match new scene structure

## Current Status:
- ✅ Main menu displays properly on game start
- ✅ World generation UI fits in 16:9 viewport with scroll support
- ✅ World generation no longer stalls at 89%
- ⏳ Need to test complete generation flow works smoothly

## Next Steps:
1. Test world generation with new UI layout
2. Verify all sliders and controls work correctly
3. Test different world sizes (32x32 to 128x128)
4. Test menu navigation flow thoroughly
5. Add fire system and god powers testing

## Technical Notes:
- WorldGenerator defaults to 64x64 for performance
- UI supports 32x32 to 128x128 world sizes in 16-tile increments  
- Generation yields every 2 rows to prevent stalling
- ScrollContainer ensures compatibility with various screen sizes
- Two-column layout maximizes space usage in 16:9 viewports
